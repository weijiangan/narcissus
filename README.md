Original desc: JS implemented in JS

Checked out this code manually from Mozilla's DXR website because I can't find a way to download the source.

Steve Yegge ported this code to Emacs-Lisp for his js2-mode's Ejacs interpreter, and the reason he chose this is because it was relatively small. I thought this would be a good study material later so I decided to save it.
